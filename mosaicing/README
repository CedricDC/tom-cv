Guide to building and use RT-AIM Real-time aerial image mosaicing software (for single camera SLAM, see BoWSLAM/README)

Contents:
1) Required libraries
2) What to build
3) Configuration + running

Linux + gcc recommended, although the mosaicing software has been built and run under Windows.


1) Required libraries

All of my code requires the following 3 libraries (see http://www.hilandtom.com/tombotterill/code/index.php#install)

1) boost http://www.boost.org/ (a recent version like 1.42.0, or the latest) including compiled libraries. Upgrade to 1.42.0 or later if you cannot build files using boost::spirit 

2) Eigen v2 (shortly to be upgraded to Eigen 3.0 which should increase performance substantially. Builds but does not work with the beta version of Eigen 3)

3) opencv 2.2 (should also work with 2.0 or 2.1 -- #define USE_OLD_OPENCV to use these)

These libraries must all be visible to gcc (automatic with OpenCV2.2, and the boost Ubuntu/Debian package).


2) What to build

Netbeans IDE 6.9 or later recommended (Eclipse CDT also works). The netbeans makefiles also work from a terminal.

a) Check out entire workspace:

svn co https://open.grcnz.com/svn/point-stereo/trunk/workspace

b) Either build mosaicing project from Netbeans, or cd workspace/mosaicing; make. This should build each individual library: util, params, image, imagesource, ransac, cameraGeom, timer, bagOfWords


3) Configuration 

Edit a config file, e.g. workspace/mosaicing/default.cfg
**You need to give a path to the folder where your images are found**


4) Camera calibration

If radial distortion is low, then calibration is not necessary, but you still need a calib.txt

Save a file called calib.txt *in the same folder as your images*. Something like this; change the 320x240 to match your image centre:

1 0 320
0 1 240
0 0 1

0


5) Running

cd workspace/mosaicing

Then start mosaicing with something like:
./[netbeans_build_dir]/mosaicing ./default.cfg


Good luck!
