Test timer

Add constraint on submatrix of LM --doesn't seem to help (outliers again)

Eigen 3 

Sparse SVD? SVD for rotations as well as scale drift (*can I use the same cycles??*)

Faster Shi-Tomasi corners, try out SURF, improve cluster re-assignment

Motion model--add to TORO map. Also fix TORO variances by looking at variance of MEDIAN analytically.

Upright mode--limit match distances in y direction.
Output: Select different combination of axes (for maps and for Toro 2d)

Bag-of-Words--use new BF matching

How are weights affected when more images are added--todo look through and check

On LC start merging nodes.

Patch descriptors should be subpixel-sampled --IS THE DOWNSAMPLER WRECKING PATCHES?!

Fixed radius clustering, dynamic word initialisation, fast mapping to new clusters

**getCorrespondences might also find 1-1 corr's at higher level**
To test getCorrespondences look at which clusters descriptors are being mapped to, is the next closest too close??

For mapping, remove the nodes with high badness compared to neighbours. 

Polymorphic RANSAC datapoint type (for 3d point align)

Test Cluster in seperate thread

Update SCORE to use real variances

Choose links to add to map for refinement

Prior prob for bow matches

Find remaining statics/externs

intLog, intPow to config.h (or lookup.h??)

extend thread to transfer CException

Fast Norms: Try MMX. Also can a K-d tree search be modified for speed???

//Make a symlink from workspace to Boost, Eigen, Opencv. find and fix /home/tom/ws/opencv/include/opencv issues

Get example working

Separate out clustering

Change library build target to ../../LibsDebug, etc.

\*\s*\w+\s*=\s*new to ARRAY, smart pointers

Model number of words--something like:
* rate new words observed
* world contains 1000000 unique words....
* Descriptor space can be partitioned into huge number/not so huge number of words.
* experiment
Read lit!

//Ostringstream that dumps to cout when out of scope (so TS, and less locking)
class print
{

}

#define CHECK(x,s) _DEBUG && check(x, s)
inline function _DEBUG && check(x, s) //stops x being evaluated???
{
	if (x)...
}??????

Make ParamClass a recursive template class??? To reduce coding needed to setup
ParamClass<class p1, class paramClass> p1=CNumParam<int, 23,25,24,"NAME"> ???

Homography refinement, improve
Eigen inversion, SVD, Real eigendecomposition
VS2005 project files+solution (script)

///////////////////////////////

Can a class override double/int etc. and count unnecessary operations??
sqrt(1) etc.
sqrt(1.01) etc that should be bin. expanded,
repeated assignment of same value (==repeated log(x) or whatever)

*unused assignments*
*uninitialised use*
nan/inf

Need an 'instrument' method that recursively updates code in a directory--adding a header and replacing double with CDouble everywhere maybe. (* flag sizeof(8*....))


Could do the same with a smart pointer?

Also find values never accessed, especially class members and member functions that are never read.

////////////////////

Change Harris/Shi-Tomasi detector to calculate local gradient as d f(x)/dx
where f is the patch function (RGB) or whatever.

KNOWN ISSUES etc.

Patch sampler orientation-invariance and illumination-invariance believed to be buggy. Also isn't subsampling properly around patches, works well enough though. Fix coming soon.

OpenCV corner detection is buggy also (v1.1 and 1.0) as it doesn't sort corners correctly.

SURF and SIFT features haven't been tested for a while

In Windows only colour input images should be used (I think greyscale images will be opened as 3-channel colour images). 

TF-IDF calculation varies in literature. I'll be confirming I'm using the correct one at some stage.

Better algorithms, e.g. Trivedi's and H+Z gold standard algorithm should be used for final essential matrix refinement.
